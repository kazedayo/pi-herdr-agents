/**
 * The HarnessAdapter seam: the single interface every agent engine implements.
 *
 * This is the inversion the product is built on. Today the engines are Pi and
 * (stubbed) Claude Code; tomorrow any agent CLI is "just" a subprocess with a
 * prompt interface. The orchestration core never knows which one it drives.
 *
 * Dependency direction: adapters import @ephemeralabs/maestro-core (for types) and never
 * the reverse. Adapters also never import @ephemeralabs/maestro-surfaces; when an agent
 * should run inside a multiplexer pane, the CLI passes a core-defined
 * SurfaceHandle in SpawnOptions.surface.
