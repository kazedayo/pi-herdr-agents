# Pi Herdr Agents

![Pi Herdr Agents: parallel Pi agents running asynchronously in dedicated Herdr panes and managed worktrees.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giuseppecrj/pi-herdr-agents/main/docs/assets/pi-herdr-agents-gallery.png)

Asynchronous subagents and approved review workflows for [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), running exclusively in [Herdr](https://herdr.dev).

Delegate investigation, implementation, and review without blocking the parent session. Each child runs as a real Pi process in its own Herdr surface; results return automatically when the child finishes.

## Features

- **Non-blocking delegation** — `subagent` acknowledges launch immediately while the parent keeps working.
- **Parallel execution** — run independent scouts, workers, and reviewers at the same time.
- **Live supervision** — track process and turn state in Pi's subagent widget; interrupt one child turn without destroying its session.
- **Managed worktrees** — isolate writing agents in retained Herdr workspaces with explicit Git ownership and recovery details.
- **Conversation handoff** — continue the active Pi conversation in a new worktree with `/worktree` while preserving the parent session.
- **Approved review workflows** — prepare and run bounded, read-only multi-agent reviews with fresh evidence and one synthesized result.
- **Reusable roles** — use bundled agents, project or global definitions, and installable role packs.

## Requirements

- [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) with package support
- [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) and its CLI
- `HERDR_ENV=1` — start Pi from inside Herdr

Other terminal multiplexers are not supported. Worktrees isolate Git checkouts, not processes or permissions; child agents and installed Pi packages run with your user account's access.

## Install

Install from npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-herdr-agents
```

Install project-locally or try it for one run:

```bash
pi install -l npm:pi-herdr-agents
pi -e npm:pi-herdr-agents
```

Then start Pi inside Herdr:

```bash
herdr
pi
```

Restart or `/reload` Pi after installation. Review package source before installing any Pi package.

## Quick start

Ask Pi to delegate naturally:

```text
Use two scouts in parallel to map the authentication flow, then summarize their findings.
```

Or launch a named role directly:

```text
/subagent scout Analyze the authentication module and report relevant files and risks
```

For an isolated writing task:

```text
/worktree auth-fix Implement the approved authentication fix and run the focused tests
```

Pi can also call the tool directly:

```typescript
subagent({ name: "Auth scout", agent: "scout", model: "<provider>/<fast-tier-id>", thinking: "low", task: "Map the authentication flow" });
subagent({ name: "DB scout", agent: "scout", model: "<provider>/<fast-tier-id>", thinking: "low", task: "Map the session schema" });
// Both return immediately; each result comes back independently.
```

Use ordinary panes for read-only agents. A single or sequential writer can work in the parent checkout; give each parallel independent writing agent a unique managed worktree. The parent acts as coordinator: decompose work, give each child one bounded outcome with its goal, allowed files, verification, and commit instruction, and keep dependent writes sequential. Children are leaves by default; the parent owns integration and final verification. See [Worktree subagents](docs/worktree-subagents.md).

## How it works

![Pi Herdr Agents lifecycle: spawn a child, run it in Herdr, supervise live state, and deliver one bounded result to the parent.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giuseppecrj/pi-herdr-agents/main/docs/assets/async-subagent-lifecycle.png)

A `subagent` call creates a dedicated Herdr pane or worktree, launches a child Pi session, and returns `started`. The parent watcher combines Herdr process state with child activity details and projects the result into a live widget:

```text
╭─ Subagents ──────────────────── 1 active · 1 open ─╮
│ 00:23  Scout: Auth (scout)        active · read 7m │
│ 00:45  Reviewer (reviewer)              waiting 2m │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

When the child completes, the parent receives one bounded `subagent_result` message and starts a new turn with that result in context. Callers never need to poll, tail session files, or wait in a shell loop.

## Troubleshooting completion delivery

If a child finishes but the parent returns an empty or unrelated response, first verify that the result reached the parent session:

```bash
jq -c 'select(.type == "custom_message" and .customType == "subagent_result")' "$PI_SESSION_FILE" | tail -1
```

If the entry exists, spawning and result extraction worked; investigate parent wake-up and model-facing delivery rather than the child process. Completion wake-ups must contain the bounded result directly—do not send a separate message that merely tells the parent to look at an adjacent custom message.

Git package refs are pinned. To move an installed development copy back to the current `main`, install that ref explicitly and reload the active Pi session:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/giuseppecrj/pi-herdr-agents@main
# Then run /reload inside Pi.
```

Smoke-test delivery with an autonomous subagent instructed to return one exact marker. Success means the marker itself—not only a generic wake-up notice—automatically appears in the parent turn.

Subagent tabs, panes, and worktree workspaces are created without stealing keyboard focus. Launch commands target child panes by explicit ID, so focus and command delivery are independent. If a fresh or resumed launch fails, the extension closes the ordinary pane that it created and preserves the original launch error. It does not close a caller-supplied surface, and managed worktree workspaces remain retained on failure. Note: the `interactive` option controls parent status notifications, not terminal focus.

### Taxonomy and discovery

This package uses five distinct concepts:

- An **agent role** is a directly runnable responsibility such as scouting,
  implementation, or review.
- A **workflow** is a user-facing recipe that composes roles, ordering,
  artifacts, and runtime policy.
- A **skill** is a Pi-native procedure loaded into the current agent. Skills are
  dependencies of roles or workflows, not subagent definitions.
- A **runtime** is the authenticated Pi provider/model and thinking policy used
  for one invocation.

See [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-agent-workflow-skill-runtime-taxonomy.md) for the
accepted decision, rationale, migration boundaries, and evidence.

The current workflow inventory is:

| Workflow | Entry point | Composition, artifacts, and runtime |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Planning | `/plan` | Autonomous scout → interactive planner → workers → reviewer; writes `.pi/plans/...` artifacts; runs on Pi. |
| Iteration | `/iterate` | Opens one interactive full-context Pi fork and returns its completion summary. |
| Side question | `/btw`, `/btw-close` | Opens one replaceable interactive Pi side session; its answer stays outside the parent transcript. |
| Worktree handoff | `/worktree <name> [task]`, `/worktree list` | Forks the active conversation into a long-lived interactive Pi process in a new worktree created from committed `HEAD`; retains the parent session. |
| Approved review runner | `herdr_workflow` (low-level control tool) | Validates and runs exact approved project-local JavaScript with bounded read-only Pi reviewers. The bundled `orchestrate` skill authors generic and adversarial review topologies. |
| Adversarial review | `/skill:orchestrate` (preferred), `adversarial-reviewer` (compatibility) | The preferred procedure uses exact approval, a pinned runner-owned checkout, risk-based discovery, candidate-dependent verification, and fresh synthesis. The compatibility coordinator uses public asynchronous children when the hardened prerequisites are unavailable. |

### Bundled visible definitions

| Definition | Classification | Default runtime | Responsibility |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| **planner** | Coordinator agent role | Config, then parent | Clarifies requirements, explores approaches, and writes plans with ordered tasks. |
| **scout** | Leaf agent role | Config, then parent | Maps relevant code, conventions, and verification paths. |
| **worker** | Leaf agent role | Config, then parent | Implements bounded tasks and verifies the result. |
| **reviewer** | Leaf agent role | Config, then parent | Reviews changes for correctness, security, and maintainability. |
| **visual-tester** | Leaf agent role | Config, then parent | Performs visual QA through the `chrome-cdp` skill. |
| **poteto** | Coordinator agent role | Config, then parent | Autonomously investigates, edits minimally, delegates independent work, and verifies. |
| **adversarial-reviewer** | Compatibility coordinator role | Exact eligible authenticated Pi models selected by risk and project policy | Runs two routine or three high-risk discovery reviewers, candidate-dependent cross-family verification, and fresh synthesis through public asynchronous children. |

All subagents execute through Pi. Claude models remain available through normal
Pi provider/model routing. Legacy role definitions that contain `cli` fail before
Herdr creates a pane or worktree; remove `cli` and `cli-model`, then select an
authenticated Pi `provider/model-id`.

Optional prerequisites fail closed and are not bundled:

- `visual-tester` needs an external `chrome-cdp` skill that provides `scripts/cdp.mjs`.
- Adversarial review needs a resolved standalone `reviewer` role, confirmed human-only authorship or known author model families, and enough distinct exact authenticated Pi models to satisfy project author-family exclusion and cross-family verification. Routine discovery uses two distinct IDs; concrete high-risk surfaces use three distinct lenses. The preferred `orchestrate` procedure fails closed when its pinned committed checkout, complete diff evidence, origin, or runtime prerequisites are unavailable. The compatibility coordinator can use a project-approved reduced topology only when it discloses the omitted coverage.
- `/plan` uses the bundled scout and planner roles and records ordered tasks in
  `plan.md`; it does not require a researcher role, todo tool, or `write-todos` skill.

This package does not install optional prerequisites.

Bundled agents use model defaults from the subagent config file (see
[Configuration](#configuration)) when configured; otherwise
they inherit the parent model. Thinking defaults still come from agent
frontmatter or the parent level. This resolution chain remains available as a
fallback, but orchestrators should explicitly set each child's exact
authenticated `provider/model-id` and supported thinking level. Select the
model tier first: fast for bounded mechanical work and recon, mid for ordinary
implementation or review, and frontier for architecture, security, hard
diagnosis, or adversarial review. Then select thinking within that model's
supported range. Independent reviewers must use a different provider/family
than the model that produced the work; a stronger model in the same family is a
quality escalation, not independent review.

Discovery loads definitions in **package → global → project** order, so effective
priority remains **project** (`.pi/agents/`) > **global**
(`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/agents/`, defaulting to `~/.pi/agent/agents/`) >
**package**. Package definitions include bundled roles and roles contributed by
installed Pi role packs. Both `subagents_list` and `/subagent list` show each
visible definition's source; contributed roles include their package identity,
for example `(package:@acme/security-roles)`. A hidden higher-priority definition
still suppresses a visible lower-priority definition.

Custom roles and installable role packs are the package's main extension points.
See [Custom Agents](#custom-agents) for the complete create, package, verify, and
launch workflow.

## Async Subagent Flow

```
1. Agent calls subagent()          → returns immediately ("started")
2. Sub-agent runs in herdr pane    → widget shows live status
3. User keeps chatting             → main session fully interactive
4. Sub-agent finishes              → result steered back as a normal completion/failure
5. Main agent processes result     → continues with new context
```

Multiple subagents run concurrently — each steers its result back independently as it finishes. Active watchers survive parent `/reload`, `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork` transitions, so completion is delivered into the replacement session. Quitting Pi still stops parent-side delivery. The live widget above the input tracks every agent still in flight:

```
╭─ Subagents ──────────────────── 1 active · 2 open ─╮
│ 01:23  Scout: Auth (scout)             active · read 7m │
│ 00:45  Reviewer (reviewer)                   stalled 4m │
│ 00:12  Scout: DB (scout)                      starting… │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Completion messages render with a colored background and are expandable with `Ctrl+O`. Results larger than 16,000 characters are abbreviated in the parent context while preserving their beginning, conclusion, and session path; the complete result remains in the child session. The extension includes that bounded result and a continuation instruction directly in the single custom `subagent_result` message that triggers or steers Pi, avoiding empty turns caused by a separate context-free wake-up. The renderer uses the unadorned bounded result from structured details. Completed rows are removed from the widget as soon as their result is delivered or suppressed.

### In-progress status updates

The widget projects each sub-agent from a **process + turn lifecycle**:

- **Herdr pane inspection** is the coarse authority for whether the child process is present and whether Herdr reports it as idle, working, blocked, or done.
- **Child activity snapshots** enrich the label with Pi-only detail (tool name, streaming, etc.) when available.
- Session JSONL is still used for transcript, resume, lineage, and result extraction — not for liveness.

Projected labels include:

- `starting` — launched; pane/activity confirmation is still settling
- `active` — processing work (agent turn, provider request, streaming, or tool execution)
- `blocked` — Herdr reports the child as blocked
- `waiting` — turn finished; the process is intentionally open for more input or another stage
- `interrupted` — the current turn was cancelled (Escape / `subagent_interrupt`); the process stays open and is **not** treated as active processing
- `stalled` — pane inspection is unhealthy long enough that the parent can no longer trust the run
- `running` — fallback when only coarse process presence is known (e.g. non-Pi backends)
- `finalizing` — completion was observed and delivery is in progress; the process elapsed timer freezes here

The widget header counts **active** vs **open**:

- **active** — `active`, `starting`, `running`, or `blocked`
- **open** — everything else still tracked (`waiting`, `interrupted`, `stalled`, `finalizing`, …)

When `activeCount === 0` (every tracked row is open), the border uses an amber accent. Process elapsed time (`MM:SS` on the left) freezes when the process reaches finalizing/completed/failed. Interrupt does **not** freeze that process clock; the interrupted state shows its own duration on the right while the process remains open.

A fixed internal watchdog marks a run as `stalled` when pane inspection fails or the pane disappears without a completion sidecar; valid long-running `active` or `waiting` states do not become `stalled` just because time passes. When a run enters `stalled` or recovers from it, the parent agent receives a steer message so it can react. All other status transitions stay in the widget only.

**Interactive subagents stay silent.** Long-running user-driven subagents (e.g. `planner`, or any `/iterate` fork) do not wake the parent session on `stalled`/`recovered` transitions — the user is working directly in the subagent's pane, and a steer message there would just burn an orchestrator turn on a no-op "still waiting" ping. The widget still updates normally, and activity snapshots are still recorded/classified regardless of the `interactive` setting. By default, agents with `auto-exit: true` are treated as autonomous and get stall pings; agents without it are treated as interactive and stay quiet. Override per-agent with `interactive: true|false` in frontmatter, or per-spawn with `interactive: true|false` on the tool call.

#### Configuration

The extension reads one JSON config file. The canonical location is
`~/.pi/agent/pi-herdr-agents.config.json`—outside the installed package, so
package updates cannot overwrite it. When pi's `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` override
is set, the extension reads `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/pi-herdr-agents.config.json`
instead.

If the user-level file is absent, the extension falls back to `config.json` in
the installed package root—the directory containing this README and
`package.json`, not `pi-extension/subagents/` or Herdr's `config.toml`. That
fallback exists for development checkouts: it is package-local, and npm or git
package updates may overwrite it. Common global package roots are:

- npm: `~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/pi-herdr-agents/`
- git: `~/.pi/agent/git/<host>/<owner>/pi-herdr-agents/`

Project-local installs use the corresponding `.pi/npm/` or `.pi/git/` root.
From the actual package root, copy the example when you want local overrides:

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

```json
{
  "status": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "models": {
    "agents": {}
  },
  "roles": {
    "bundled": true
  },
  "panes": {
    "mode": "tab",
    "direction": "right"
  }
}
```

With no user-level file and no package-root `config.json`, status, role, and
pane settings fall back to `config.json.example`. Model routing does not read
the example: no model overrides apply until a real config file exists.

The copyable example is model-neutral, so it works without requiring credentials
for a specific provider. To configure models, replace the empty section with
exact IDs from your authenticated model catalog:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "default": "your-provider/your-default-model",
    "agents": {
      "scout": "your-provider/your-fast-model",
      "reviewer": "your-provider/your-review-model"
    }
  }
}
```

Set `roles.bundled` to `false` to exclude this package's bundled role definitions from listing and exact-name launch. It defaults to `true`. Registered role packs remain available, and global and project definitions keep their existing precedence. A role-pack name collides with a bundled role only while that bundled layer is enabled; when it is disabled, the role pack can supply that name.

Set `panes.mode` to `"split"` to open ordinary public `subagent` and `subagent_resume` launches, including bare forks and `/iterate`, as splits of the stable parent pane. Set `panes.direction` to `"right"` or `"down"`; it defaults to `"right"` and is ignored when mode is `"tab"`. The default `"tab"` mode preserves existing behavior. Managed worktrees still use separate workspaces, while approved workflow readers and `/btw` keep their existing tab behavior.

Run `/reload` after changing role, model, or pane settings.

`models.default` sets the model for subagents that do not specify a model.
`models.agents` sets per-agent defaults, keyed by the agent name passed to
`subagent({ agent: ... })`. Explicit `model` tool arguments take precedence,
followed by agent frontmatter, per-agent config, the global default, and finally
the parent model. Model values must be exact authenticated `provider/model-id`
references. A value can contain an ordered comma-separated fallback list, for
example `provider/preferred, provider/fallback`. The extension validates every
candidate before launch, then launches later candidates only after the selected
child settles with a provider/agent error. Pi owns any automatic transient
retrying inside that child; the extension does not infer retry counts or
permanence from the error text. A completed child result, including a negative
task result, never switches models. Completion metadata reports the requested
candidate, every attempted candidate, the model actually used, and each raw
model failure in attempt order when fallbacks are tried. Workflow metadata accepts one exact
model only, to keep approved workflow runtimes deterministic.

A catalog-listed model and configured authentication do not prove that the
active provider account can use that model. Providers may reject an account /
model combination only when the request is made. The completion preserves each
raw provider reason with its model and suggests checking account access,
spawning a new subagent with a supported model, or choosing an appropriate
configured fallback. `subagent_resume` does not select a model and should be
used only after the session's stored model is usable. The completion does not
claim a permanent failure or a retry count that Pi has not exposed. Reliable
structured permanence and retry counts require an upstream Pi/ExtensionAPI
diagnostics seam for final provider errors and retry outcomes.

`config.json` is gitignored in the source tree so local overrides are not
committed from a checkout. On an installed package, prefer the user-level file;
migrate an existing package-root config with:

```bash
cp ~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/pi-herdr-agents/config.json \
	~/.pi/agent/pi-herdr-agents.config.json
```

Adjust the source path for git installs or a custom `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`.

Run `/reload` after changing the config; status, model, role, and pane
configuration are loaded when the extension starts.

## Spawning Subagents

```typescript
// Explicit fast-tier runtime for bounded reconnaissance
subagent({ name: "Scout", agent: "scout", model: "<provider>/<fast-tier-id>", thinking: "low", task: "Analyze the codebase..." });

// Force a full-context fork for this spawn
subagent({ name: "Iterate", fork: true, model: "<provider>/<mid-tier-id>", thinking: "medium", task: "Fix the bug where..." });

// Explicit frontier-tier runtime for architecture work
subagent({ name: "Planner", agent: "planner", model: "<provider>/<frontier-tier-id>", thinking: "high", task: "Work through the design with me" });

// Explicit mid-tier runtime with a custom working directory
subagent({ name: "Designer", agent: "game-designer", model: "<provider>/<mid-tier-id>", thinking: "medium", cwd: "agents/game-designer", task: "..." });

// Isolated ticket branch in a Herdr-managed Git worktree
subagent({
  name: "Ticket 123",
  agent: "worker",
  model: "<provider>/<mid-tier-id>",
  thinking: "medium",
  worktree: { branch: "ticket/123", base: "main" },
  task: "Implement ticket 123, test it, and commit the result",
});
```

### Parameters

| Parameter              | Type    | Default        | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                 | string  | required       | Short stable child label; coordinated groups use `<task>-<role>[-n]` (widget and pane title)      |
| `task`                 | string  | required       | Task prompt for the sub-agent                                                                     |
| `agent`                | string  | —              | Load defaults from agent definition                                                               |
| `fork`                 | boolean | `false`        | Force the full-context fork mode for this spawn, overriding any agent `session-mode` frontmatter  |
| `interactive`          | boolean | derived        | Mark this spawn as interactive (don't wake the parent on stall/recovery). Defaults to the agent's `interactive` frontmatter, otherwise the inverse of `auto-exit`. |
| `model`                | string  | configured or parent | Exact authenticated `provider/model-id`, or an ordered comma-separated Pi fallback list; fallback lists are unavailable for worktree spawns. Resolution is tool argument → agent frontmatter → per-agent config → global config → parent |
| `thinking`             | string  | parent level   | Pick the model tier first, then set thinking within that model's range: minimal/low for bounded mechanical work, medium for ordinary implementation or review, high+ for architecture, security, or hard diagnosis. Omitting still inherits the parent level; this is a discouraged fallback for orchestrated children. |
| `systemPrompt`         | string  | —              | Role/system-prompt text for a bare spawn; named agents keep their definition body                  |
| `skills`               | string  | —              | Comma-separated skill names                                                                       |
| `tools`                | string  | —              | Comma-separated tool names                                                                        |
| `cwd`                  | string  | —              | Working directory, or source repository when `worktree` is set (see [Role Folders](#role-folders)) |
| `worktree`             | object  | —              | Isolated Herdr-managed Git worktree; requires `branch`, with optional `base` (committed `HEAD` by default) |
| `workspace`            | string  | current space  | Herdr workspace ID for the child's tab. Cannot be combined with `worktree`. If omitted and `cwd` is inside a retained worktree, that worktree's space is used. |

### Naming coordinated children

Before launching a new group, choose a short task slug and label each new child
`<task>-<role>[-n]`, such as `login-api` or `login-test2`. Roles are `plan`,
`research`, `ui`, `api`, `build`, `test`, `review`, `browser`, `security`,
`perf`, and `merge`. Leave existing labels unchanged. After the final launch,
print `name | agent kind | role | model | worktree` and use each name in
prompts, handoffs, and results.

### Isolated worktree runs

Use one worktree per parallel independent writing task; a single or sequential writer can work in the parent checkout, and read-only agents use ordinary panes. `cwd` selects the source Git repository, `branch` must be unique, and `base` is resolved to an exact commit before creation. If `base` is omitted, the source checkout's committed `HEAD` is used. Parent-checkout changes that have not been committed are not copied.

A launch with `worktree` and an effective bundled `scout`, `reviewer`, or `adversarial-reviewer` returns a non-blocking warning. Scouts and reviewers normally need an ordinary pane; the adversarial reviewer is a compatibility coordinator that uses an ordinary pane for its child reviewers. To inspect or review an existing worker result, start an ordinary child in that retained worktree path. Project or global role overrides do not receive these bundled-role warnings. A `read,bash` allowlist is not an enforced read-only boundary because shell commands can mutate files; report-only roles must restrict Bash to safe inspection and avoid artifact-generating verification in the reviewed checkout.

The child starts at the returned worktree root. Tell writing agents to test and commit when you want a commit-based handoff, and tell them not to push, merge, switch branches, or remove the worktree. The parent owns review and integration.

Successful, failed, and help-requesting runs retain their workspace. Completion includes the worktree path, Herdr workspace, branch, base/head SHAs, commits ahead, changed and untracked files, and clean/dirty/conflicted state. Here, `clean` means no uncommitted files; the branch may still contain commits. If Git inspection fails, state is reported as unknown rather than guessed.

An ownership manifest is written under the parent session's `artifacts/<session-id>/worktree-runs/` directory before Herdr creates resources. V1 does not automatically recover watchers after a full process restart. `subagent_resume` can open the new tab in a retained worktree's Herdr workspace, but it does not reattach the managed worktree lifecycle.

The extension does **not** push, create a PR, merge, cherry-pick, or remove the worktree or branch automatically. For task selection, lifecycle states, review commands, failure recovery, and safe cleanup, read [Worktree subagents](docs/worktree-subagents.md). The [research report](docs/research/worktree-subagent-orchestration.md) records the rationale and deferred roadmap.

## Interrupting a running subagent

Use `subagent_interrupt` to cancel the active turn of a running Pi-backed subagent:

```typescript
subagent_interrupt({ id: "abcd1234" });
// or
subagent_interrupt({ name: "Scout" });
```

This sends Escape to the child pane, cancelling the in-progress model turn. The subagent session stays alive — the pane, session file, and background polling all remain intact. After the interrupt, the widget immediately labels the child as `interrupted` (counted as **open**, not active processing). Stale pre-interrupt activity snapshots are ignored so a lagging Herdr/`active` reading cannot overwrite the interrupt. The process elapsed timer keeps running because the pane is still open; only the interrupted-state duration freezes relative to the interrupt request. If the child starts work later, newer observations return it to `active`; completion, failure, and `caller_ping` still flow through normally.

`id` and `name` are each optional, but execution requires one usable target: an exact running ID or an exact, unambiguous display name. When both are supplied, `id` is used. Duplicate names are rejected.

This is a turn-level interrupt, not a method for forcibly terminating a subagent session.

---

## Workflow control (`herdr_workflow`)

The parent-only `herdr_workflow` tool prepares, starts, and cancels one exact project-local review workflow. Children never receive this tool.

```typescript
herdr_workflow({ action: "prepare", path: ".pi/plans/run-1/workflow.js" });
herdr_workflow({ action: "start", runId: "run-1" }); // after APPROVE <hash prefix>
herdr_workflow({ action: "cancel", runId: "run-1" });
```

Parameters:

- `action` (required): `prepare`, `start`, or `cancel`.
- `path` (required for `prepare`): Path to the workflow script.
- `runId` (required for `cancel` and `start`): For `start`, it must match the pending run.

### Prepare and start contract

- The script must be `<project>/.pi/plans/<run>/workflow.js` in a trusted Git repository with no existing adjacent `run.jsonl`.
- Its first comment contains strict version-1 JSON metadata that binds the exact committed base, source provenance, distinct review-node IDs and their roles, authenticated `provider/model` references, thinking levels, and the configurable `maxAgents` and `maxConcurrency` caps.
- Fixed workflow caps: 256 KiB source, 8 agents, concurrency 4, 30-minute deadline, 100,000-character prompts, 100 logs × 4,000 characters, and 64 KiB serialized task result. Metadata may lower only `maxAgents` and `maxConcurrency`.
- Preparation validates and compiles without evaluating JavaScript, creating a journal or checkout, or launching a child. It returns the exact approval packet and keeps one pending candidate in process memory.
- Start requires the latest real user message in the same parent session to be exactly `APPROVE <8 lowercase hex characters>`. It revalidates the complete candidate, consumes approval once, creates the append-only journal, and runs in the background.
- Review children are fresh Pi sessions with derived read-only tools in one detached checkout pinned to the approved base. Parent uncommitted files are absent, intermediate child results stay inside the workflow, and operational failures remain explicit non-retryable evidence for parent-guided recovery.
- Approved workflow JavaScript runs in a restricted `vm` inside a Worker thread. Neither mechanism is a security boundary; run only project code that the user has inspected and approved.
- Same-process `/reload` keeps workflow ownership and the Worker alive. A full process restart performs interruption reconciliation only: it marks a stale running journal event `interrupted`, retains sessions/journals/checkouts, and does not replay, restart children, clean up, or expose history.

### Cancel contract

- Cancel claims a process-global terminal gate. Completion, failure, interruption, and cancellation cannot each produce a terminal outcome.
- Queued `agent()` calls resolve as cancelled; no later reviewer or synthesizer starts.
- New panes are queried through Herdr process-info until their interactive shell is ready before launch. Active panes are queried again before close so foreground process identities can be waited on.
- After synchronous pane close, cancel waits for pane absence and captured process exit before disposing the reader checkout.
- If process identity cannot be captured for an active pane, the pane remains present after close, or any captured process still lives after the bounded wait, the checkout is retained and the run ends `failed` with `cancel_termination_failed`. Successful cancellation is not reported in that case.
- A successful cancel writes one `cancelled` terminal journal event and one result-free delivery. Repeated cancel is idempotent and returns the authoritative terminal outcome (including a prior fail-closed result).

Every terminal path—normal completion, early script return, script or Worker failure, deadline, interruption, and explicit cancellation—stops queued work and accounts for active workflow children before checkout disposal or final delivery. If active-child exit cannot be confirmed, the checkout is retained and the authoritative outcome is `failed` with `cancel_termination_failed`.

There is no list, status, resume, or history action in v1. Workflow ownership and the Worker survive `/reload` in the same Pi process, and the latest parent API receives one final delivery. A full process restart reconciles interruption without replay: startup marks only the last known running journal event as `interrupted`, leaves sessions, journals, and reader checkouts in place, and requires a new approved run.

### Bundled `orchestrate` skill

The package bundles the native `/skill:orchestrate` procedure. It accepts local paths, URLs, tickets, or combinations that the parent can already access. The parent performs read-only preflight discovery; pins exact repository, comparison base, checkout head, author origin, and task/spec evidence; and materializes the changed-file inventory plus unified diff or complete before/after excerpts before writing one unique `.pi/plans/<run>/workflow.js`. Deleted and base-only content must be included because head-checkout reads cannot recover it. If complete evidence cannot fit runner limits, preparation stops for narrower scope instead of silently losing evidence. The skill authors distinct fresh standalone review nodes in bounded parallel and one fresh synthesis node. Every child assignment treats code, PR text, reports, and command output as untrusted data. It does not use public `subagent()` for workflow nodes and does not author writers, commits, external effects, nested workflows, replay, or a fixed runtime-wide task schema.

Its adversarial branch uses two distinct eligible exact model IDs for routine risk or three distinct lenses for concrete high-risk surfaces, then only candidate-dependent P0/P1 or high-risk verification and one fresh synthesis. Finding records use stable IDs, claimed P0–P3 severity, nullable confirmed severity, separate provenance, and reproduced, trace-backed, or unverified evidence rather than confidence or vote counts. An unresolved serious candidate and any valid child `INCOMPLETE` propagate task-level `INCOMPLETE` even through `ok: true`. Request-local validators reject malformed records; this schema is not a runner contract. Verifiers exclude the family that authored the report they inspect. Required author-family exclusion stops when model origin is unknown unless the evidence is confirmed human-only. Synthesis prefers another family and discloses permitted reuse.

The script and journal retain every original child envelope. Synthesis receives every outcome through an anonymous projection: canonical validated report fields for success, or failure code, retryable flag, and bounded error evidence scrubbed of known identity tokens. Session paths, child/runtime/provider names, and the separate auditable alias map are omitted from the synthesis prompt. This presentation reduces identity and order cues but is not a security boundary or proof against bias.

The runner-owned checkout contains only the pinned commit. Parent staged, unstaged, and untracked state is not review evidence. Effective child tools are the resolved role allowlist intersected with the runner maximum (`read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`) and deny rules. Public `subagent` results can be abbreviated above 16,000 characters, but workflow scripts receive complete child reports within their explicit bounds. Operational failures are preserved without silent fallback; recovery is a new exact approved run.

The parent calls `herdr_workflow prepare`, presents its packet unchanged, and waits for the exact `APPROVE <8-character lowercase hash prefix>` reply before calling `start`. After start, one final delivery is sent without polling. Every terminal path is fail-closed: it accounts for queued and active children before checkout disposal and delivery, retaining evidence when process exit cannot be confirmed. Same-process `/reload` preserves ownership; full restart records interruption without replay, restart, cleanup, or history. Workflow JavaScript runs in a Worker-hosted `vm` for event-loop availability only; neither the Worker nor `vm` is a security boundary, and worktrees do not provide process or security isolation.

## caller_ping — Child-to-Parent Help Request

The `caller_ping` tool lets a Pi-backed subagent request help from its parent agent. When called, the child session **exits** and the parent receives a notification with the help message. The parent can then **resume** the child session with a response using `subagent_resume`.

**`caller_ping` parameters:**

- `message` (required): What you need help with

**`subagent_resume` parameters (Pi-backed sessions):**

- `sessionPath` (required): Path to the child session `.jsonl` file
- `name` (optional): Display name for the resumed pane (defaults to `Resume`)
- `message` (optional): Follow-up prompt to send after resuming
- `autoExit` (optional): Whether the resumed session should auto-exit after its next response fully settles. Defaults to `true` for autonomous follow-up work; set `false` when resuming for an interactive handoff.
- `workspace` (optional): Herdr workspace ID to open the resumed tab in. Defaults to the current space, or the retained worktree space when the session cwd sits in one.

Each public child stores a session-adjacent versioned launch-policy sidecar. Public resume restores its resolved tool allowlist and denied subagent tools rather than looking up the current role, so later role changes cannot widen a child. An intentionally unrestricted launch remains unrestricted (no `--tools` argument); a restricted launch restores its exact allowlist. The `autoExit` override still controls whether `subagent_done` is available, while `caller_ping` remains available. Missing, malformed, or unsupported policy fails closed before a pane is created with recovery guidance. Public resume also rejects workflow-owned and managed-worktree child sessions; use their retained workflow evidence or workspace instead.

**Interaction flow:**

1. Child calls `caller_ping({ message: "Not sure which schema to use" })`
2. Child session exits (like `subagent_done`)
3. Parent receives a steer notification: *"Sub-agent Worker needs help: Not sure which schema to use"*
4. Parent resumes the child session via `subagent_resume` with the response
5. Child picks up where it left off with the parent's guidance

**Example:**

```typescript
// Inside a worker subagent
await caller_ping({
  message: "Found two conflicting migration files — should I use v1 or v2?"
});
// Session exits here. Parent receives the ping, then resumes this session
// with guidance like "Use v2, v1 is deprecated"
```

> **Note:** `caller_ping` is only available inside Pi-backed subagent contexts. Calling it from a standalone Pi session returns an error. For a worktree child, the help handoff retains the workspace. `subagent_resume` can open the tab in that workspace, but it does not reattach worktree tracking.

---

## The `/plan` Workflow

The `/plan` command orchestrates a full planning-to-implementation pipeline.

```
/plan Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page
```

```
Phase 1: Investigation    → Autonomous scout maps the codebase
Phase 2: Planning         → Interactive planner subagent (user collaborates)
Phase 3: Review Plan      → Confirm ordered tasks, adjust if needed
Phase 4: Execute          → Shared-checkout sequential workers by default; isolated parallel workers for independent tasks
Phase 5: Integrate        → Parent reviews and integrates worktree branches one at a time, only when worktrees are used
Phase 6: Review           → Reviewer subagent checks the integrated changes
```

The parent workspace and tab names stay unchanged. Subagents are created in newly named tabs or panes for each phase.

---

## The `/iterate` Workflow

For quick, focused work without polluting the main session's context.

```
/iterate Fix the off-by-one error in the pagination logic
```

This always forks the current session into a subagent with full conversation context. It does not inherit an agent default `session-mode`. Make the fix, verify it, and exit to return. The main session gets a summary of what was done.

---

## The `/btw` Workflow

Use `/btw` for a quick side question without adding a turn to the main session:

```text
/btw What did we decide about session cleanup?
```

The extension snapshots the current active conversation branch, opens a non-focused Herdr tab, and starts an interactive Pi session with the same model and thinking level. The answer stays in that tab and is never delivered as a subagent result. A second `/btw` replaces the previous one; `/btw-close` closes it explicitly.

BTW shares the current working directory. It treats inherited work as reference context and modifies the workspace only when the side question explicitly requests it. Cleanup is best effort; if closing fails, the tab remains available for manual recovery.

---

## The `/worktree` Workflow

`/worktree <worktree> [task]` creates a Herdr-managed worktree from the current committed branch and launches a new interactive Pi session there with the active conversation branch. The original session remains available. Use `/worktree list` to list worktrees for the current repository. This is a new-process handoff, not an in-place move of the existing shell or Pi process.

---

## Custom Agents

Custom agent roles are the package's primary extension mechanism. Create one
when a child needs a reusable, bounded responsibility such as scouting,
implementation, or review. If the new concept instead describes a multi-stage
user outcome, make it a workflow, command, or Pi skill that composes roles; do
not disguise a workflow as an agent definition.

### 1. Choose the scope

| Scope | Location | Use when |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| Project | `.pi/agents/<name>.md` | The role belongs to one repository |
| Global | `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/agents/<name>.md` | The role should be available everywhere; the default root is `~/.pi/agent` |
| Role pack | An installed Pi package's registered `roles/` directory | The role should be independently installable and shareable |
| Bundled | This package's `agents/<name>.md` | Contributing a fallback role maintained with `pi-herdr-agents` |

The filename stem is the launch key. `name` frontmatter is optional because it
defaults to the filename stem. If supplied, keep it identical so overrides remain
predictable; role packs reject mismatches.

### 2. Create the definition

```markdown
---
description: Reviews a bounded change for concrete security vulnerabilities
thinking: high
tools: read, bash
system-prompt: append
session-mode: standalone
spawning: false
auto-exit: true
---

# Security Reviewer

Review only the requested change. Trace trust boundaries and affected callers.
Report concrete findings with file and line references, exploit conditions,
severity, and the smallest safe correction. Do not modify files.
```

Omit `model` to use `models.agents.<name>`, then `models.default`, then the
parent model. Put `model` in frontmatter only when the role itself needs a
specific exact authenticated `provider/model-id`.

`tools` is passed to Pi's `--tools` allowlist and may name any registered
built-in, extension, or custom tool. Listing a tool does not install its
extension. Use one non-empty inline comma-separated scalar, such as
`tools: read, grep`; do not use YAML lists, containers, quotes, or comments.
Omitting `tools` intentionally leaves the role unrestricted. Likewise, `skills`
names must already be discoverable by Pi; this package does not install role
prerequisites.

### 3. Verify and launch

```text
/subagent list
/subagent security-reviewer Review the authentication changes against main
```

Or call the tool directly:

```typescript
subagent({
  name: "Security review",
  agent: "security-reviewer",
  task: "Review the authentication changes against main.",
});
```

Agent files are read when definitions are listed or launched, so creating or
editing one normally does not require `/reload`. Installing, removing, updating,
or changing the extension code of a role pack uses Pi's normal `/reload` flow.

### Publish a role pack

A role pack is an ordinary Pi package with Markdown definitions and a tiny
extension that registers their directory through Pi's public inter-extension
event bus:

```text
security-roles/
├── package.json
├── extension.ts
└── roles/
    └── security-reviewer.md
```

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/security-roles",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "type": "module",
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./extension.ts"]
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent": "*"
  }
}
```

```typescript
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";

const roles = fileURLToPath(new URL("./roles", import.meta.url));

export default (pi: any) => {
  const unsubscribe = pi.events.on(
    "pi-herdr-subagents:roles:discover:v1",  // stable protocol identifier
    (request: { apiVersion: number; register(path: string): void }) => {
      if (request.apiVersion === 1) request.register(roles);
    },
  );
  pi.on("session_shutdown", unsubscribe);
};
```

Install both packages through Pi; the role pack remains inert if
`pi-herdr-agents` is absent:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-herdr-agents
pi install npm:@acme/security-roles
```

Registration is synchronous and accepts one absolute Markdown file or a
directory whose direct `.md` children are roles. The bridge must unsubscribe on
`session_shutdown` as shown so removed or updated packages do not survive a
reload. A copyable package lives in [`examples/role-pack/`](examples/role-pack/).
The host reads and validates
the files, derives package name/version from the nearest `package.json`, and
reports invalid paths, missing descriptions, filename/name mismatches, and
package-layer collisions in the listing surfaces.

Role packs cannot replace an enabled bundled role, and duplicate role names
from multiple role packs are disabled rather than resolved by extension load
order. Use a global or project definition for an intentional override.

See [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-installable-role-packs.md) for the registration seam,
collision rules, and rejected alternatives.

### Authoring checklist

- The role has one bounded responsibility and a clear report or handoff contract.
- The filename stem is the role name; if `name` is present, it matches the stem.
- `description` states the role's input/output responsibility.
- `tools` and `skills` contain only installed, necessary capabilities.
- Leaf roles set `spawning: false`.
- Autonomous roles set `auto-exit: true`; interactive roles leave it off.
- Generic roles omit `model` unless a particular runtime is functionally required.
- `/subagent list` shows the expected source and a smoke launch succeeds.

Capability declarations are strict: use the unquoted, unindented keys
`tools:`, `deny-tools:`, and `spawning:` exactly once when present. Declare
`tools` and `deny-tools` as non-empty inline comma-separated scalars, and
`spawning` as exactly `true` or `false`. YAML lists, containers, multiline
values, quotes, comments, empty values, duplicates, noncanonical key spelling,
and invalid booleans are rejected. A role with an invalid capability declaration
is excluded from discovery, and an exact-name launch reports the diagnostic
before creating a Herdr pane or worktree. Other unsupported or unknown
frontmatter may still be ignored.
Compare definitions against the reference below and verify them with
`/subagent list` plus a smoke launch.

| `tools`       | string  | One non-empty inline comma-separated Pi `--tools` allowlist under the exact unquoted key `tools:`; may contain any registered built-in, extension, or custom tool name. Omit to leave unrestricted. YAML lists, containers, multiline values, quotes, comments, noncanonical keys, and duplicates are rejected. |
| `skills`      | string  | Comma-separated installed skill names to auto-load. Use this plural form for new definitions; legacy project/global definitions using singular `skill` remain compatible. |
| `session-mode` | string | Default child-session mode: `standalone`, `lineage-only`, or `fork` |
| `spawning`    | boolean | Set exactly `false` to deny all subagent-spawning tools under the exact unquoted key `spawning:`. Only one `true` or `false` declaration is accepted. |
| `deny-tools`  | string  | One non-empty inline comma-separated `pi-herdr-agents` tool list to suppress under the exact unquoted key `deny-tools:`; this is not a universal cross-extension deny list. YAML lists, containers, multiline values, quotes, comments, noncanonical keys, and duplicates are rejected. |
| `auto-exit`   | boolean | Auto-shutdown after Pi fully settles when the latest assistant turn does not end with `stopReason: "aborted"` — no `subagent_done` call needed. User input does not permanently disable auto-exit. Recommended for autonomous agents (scout, worker); not for interactive ones (planner). Also determines the default value of `interactive` (see below). |
| `interactive` | boolean | Override whether stall/recovery transitions wake the parent session. Defaults to the inverse of `auto-exit`: autonomous agents (`auto-exit: true`) are non-interactive and get stall pings; agents without `auto-exit` are interactive and stay quiet. Explicit values take precedence. |
| `cwd`         | string  | Default working directory. Absolute paths are unambiguous; relative agent-frontmatter paths resolve from Pi's agent config directory (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` or `~/.pi/agent`), not the project root                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | Hide a role from discovery surfaces like `subagents_list`. The definition remains directly invocable by exact name via `subagent({ agent: "name", ... })`. |

---

Discovery still resolves precedence before visibility filtering. If a project-local hidden agent has the same name as a visible global or bundled agent, the hidden project agent wins and the lower-precedence agent does not appear in `subagents_list`.

### `session-mode`

Choose how a subagent session starts:

- `standalone` — default fresh session with no lineage link to the caller
- `lineage-only` — fresh blank child session with `parentSession` linkage, but no copied turns from the caller
- `fork` — linked child session seeded with the caller's prior conversation context

`lineage-only` is useful when you want session discovery and fork lineage UX to show the relationship later, but you do **not** want the child to inherit the parent's turns.

`fork: true` on the tool call always forces the `fork` mode for that specific spawn. `/iterate` uses this explicit override on purpose.

```yaml
---
name: planner
session-mode: lineage-only
---
```

### `auto-exit`

When set to `true`, the agent session shuts down on Pi's `agent_settled` event unless the latest assistant message has `stopReason: "aborted"` — no explicit `subagent_done` call is needed.

**Behavior:**

- Low-level `agent_end` events do not close the session because Pi may still retry, compact and retry, or process a queued continuation.
- After `agent_settled`, a normal or error stop exits, while an aborted stop stays open.
- User input does not permanently disable auto-exit; the latest settled assistant stop reason determines whether the session exits.
- The modeHint injected into the agent's task is adjusted accordingly: autonomous agents see "Complete your task autonomously." rather than instructions to call `subagent_done`

**When to use:**

- ✅ Autonomous agents (scout, worker, reviewer) that run to completion
- ❌ Interactive agents (planner, iterate) where the user drives the session

```yaml
---
name: scout
auto-exit: true
---
```

### `interactive`

Controls whether status transitions (`stalled`, `recovered`) wake the parent session with a steer message.

**Default:** the inverse of `auto-exit`. Autonomous agents (`auto-exit: true`) are non-interactive and ping the parent on stall/recovery; named agents without `auto-exit` are interactive and stay quiet. Bare spawns have no agent definition and default to autonomous auto-exit behavior. `/iterate` is interactive because it explicitly passes `interactive: true`.

**Why it exists:** Interactive agents can run for minutes or hours while the user thinks, types, and reads in the subagent's pane. Child snapshots still update the widget, but stalled/recovered supervision messages rarely need to wake the parent for user-driven sessions. Skipping the steer keeps the parent quiet until the child actually finishes.

**When to override:**

- Set `interactive: false` on an agent that doesn't auto-exit but you still want stall pings for
- Set `interactive: true` on an autonomous agent you'd rather check on yourself

```yaml
---
name: planner
# interactive defaults to true because auto-exit is not set
---
```

Or per spawn:

```typescript
subagent({ name: "Scout", agent: "scout", interactive: true, task: "..." });
```

## Tool Access Control

Without a restrictive `tools` allowlist or spawning policy, a sub-agent can spawn further sub-agents. Control this with frontmatter:

### `spawning: false`

Denies all subagent lifecycle tools (`subagent`, `subagent_interrupt`, `subagents_list`, `subagent_resume`):

```yaml
---
name: worker
spawning: false
---
```

### `deny-tools`

Fine-grained control over tools registered by `pi-herdr-agents`:

```yaml
---
name: focused-agent
deny-tools: subagent
---
```

### Recommended Configuration

| Agent | `spawning` | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| planner | *(default)* | Can spawn scouts for investigation. |
| poteto | `true` | Delegates independent work. |
| adversarial-reviewer | `true` | Compatibility coordinator; launches bounded discovery, conditional verification, and synthesis children. It sets `auto-exit: false` so automatic child-result steers can drive every wave, then calls `subagent_done`. |
| worker | `false` | Implements bounded tasks. |
| reviewer | `false` | Reviews without delegation. |
| scout | `false` | Gathers context without delegation. |
| visual-tester | `false` | Performs visual QA without delegation. |

## Role Folders

The `cwd` parameter lets sub-agents start in a specific directory with its own configuration:

```
project/
├── agents/
│   ├── game-designer/
│   │   └── CLAUDE.md          ← "You are a game designer..."
│   ├── sre/
│   │   ├── CLAUDE.md          ← "You are an SRE specialist..."
│   │   └── .pi/skills/        ← SRE-specific skills
│   └── narrative/
│       └── CLAUDE.md          ← "You are a narrative designer..."
```

```typescript
subagent({ name: "Game Designer", cwd: "agents/game-designer", task: "Design the combat system" });
subagent({ name: "SRE", cwd: "agents/sre", task: "Review deployment pipeline" });
```

Set a default `cwd` in agent frontmatter. Use an absolute path for a project directory; relative frontmatter paths are resolved from Pi's agent config directory:

```yaml
---
name: game-designer
cwd: /absolute/path/to/project/agents/game-designer
spawning: false
---
```

---

## Tools Widget

Every sub-agent session displays a compact tools widget showing available and denied tools. Toggle with `Ctrl+J`:

```
[scout] — 12 tools · 4 denied  (Ctrl+J)              ← collapsed
[scout] — 12 available  (Ctrl+J to collapse)          ← expanded
  read, bash, edit, write, ...
  denied: subagent, subagents_list, ...
```

---

## Development

Run local checks:

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run lint
npm pack --dry-run
```

Run the required end-to-end suite from inside Herdr:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

The deterministic suite launches real Pi sessions, Herdr panes, and worktrees without provider credentials. The optional live-provider smoke test is not a merge gate:

```bash
PI_TEST_MODEL="openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna" PI_TEST_TIMEOUT=180000 \
  npm run test:integration:live
```
